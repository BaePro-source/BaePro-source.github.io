## C Language Programming

Learning the core concepts of low-level programming through C language, which serves as the foundation of computer science, including memory management, pointers, and data structures.

### Learning Topics
- **Data Structures**: Implementation of lists, stacks, queues, and trees
- **Memory Management**: Dynamic memory allocation and deallocation
- **Pointers**: Efficient data processing
- **Algorithms**: Implementation of sorting and searching algorithms

Through hardware-level programming, I'm gaining a deep understanding of how systems work.
