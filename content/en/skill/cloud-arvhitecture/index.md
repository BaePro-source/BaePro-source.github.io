## Cloud-Native Architecture Design

Learning to design and implement cloud-based system architectures with consideration for scalability, reliability, and security.

### Key Concepts
- **Microservices**: Service separation and independent deployment
- **Serverless**: Event-driven architecture design
- **High Availability**: Disaster recovery and load balancing
- **Security**: IAM, network isolation, encryption

My goal is to build data-driven scalable architectures and provide optimal cloud solutions tailored to business requirements.
