## DevOps Culture and Practices

Learning DevOps methodologies that break down the barriers between development and operations, enabling faster and more reliable software deployment through automation and collaboration.

### Core Areas
- **CI/CD**: Automation using GitHub Actions and Jenkins
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Learning Terraform and Ansible
- **Monitoring**: System performance and log analysis
- **Collaboration Tools**: Team communication using Git and Slack

My goal is to improve development productivity through continuous improvement and feedback loops, and to achieve stable service operations.
