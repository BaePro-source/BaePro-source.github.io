## Container-Based Development Environment

Learning how to build consistent development environments using Docker and efficiently package and deploy applications.

### Key Technologies
- **Docker Compose**: Defining multi-container applications
- **Image Optimization**: Creating lightweight container images
- **Volume Management**: Ensuring data persistence
- **Networking**: Configuring inter-container communication

My goal is to implement more efficient deployment processes through container orchestration and CI/CD pipeline integration.
