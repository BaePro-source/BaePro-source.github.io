## Leveraging AWS Cloud Services

Learning and practicing various cloud solutions from Amazon Web Services (AWS), gaining experience in building scalable and reliable infrastructure.

### Key Experience
- **EC2**: Creating and managing virtual server instances
- **S3**: Utilizing secure object storage
- **Lambda**: Practicing serverless computing
- **RDS**: Operating managed database services

My goal is to implement cost-optimized solutions through cloud-native application development and efficient resource management.
